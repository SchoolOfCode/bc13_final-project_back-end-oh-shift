> This is STOKKA, a mobile-first website where the user can filter board games based on their needs and preferences and can be part of an active community. 

### 🤔 Problem
> Choosing the right board game at a venue can be a confusing experience. How do you know which game is right for you? How do you quickly know the game you want is available? How do you know what the community thinks about the game? How can you match with other people wanting to play the same games as you? These are common questions that many game enthusiasts and potential boardgame cafe customers face due to the amount of options available. On the other hand, business owners may need a way to easily update their inventory and improve their customers experience at the same time. 

### 💡 Solution
> The solution to these problems is to have a way for both customers and business owners to easily find what they are looking for, whether it's a game to play or a smart way to display their inventory and improve their customers experience. This is where Stokka comes in, a mobile-first web application that helps users find the right board game at a board game venue and also enables business owners to advertise their game collection to customers.
